# Exercises-Solutions-of-State-Estimation-for-Robotics
I provided my own solutions to the exercises of the State Estimation for Robotics book.
There is no gaurantee that my solutions are correct. I used the paper of Toyota Research Institue. 
I spent my spare time to workout the solutions with the hope that what I learned can help my work.
